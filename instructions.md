NavyBits Internship Challenge - Build a Sudoku
Game in React and TypeScript
NavyBits Internship Challenge: Build a Sudoku Game in React and TypeScript
Are you ready to showcase your skills and creativity with a unique coding challenge?
NavyBits is looking for talented interns to join our team, and we’re inviting you to
demonstrate your coding and problem-solving prowess through an exciting project:
Building a dynamic, fully-functional Sudoku game!
This challenge will test your skills in frontend development, algorithm design, and innovative
problem-solving, with a progressive structure that will push you to achieve more every step
of the way. Here’s what you need to know:
Challenge Overview
We’re asking you to create a Sudoku game application using React and TypeScript. The
goal is to develop a game that not only allows users to play but also includes features like
generating new puzzles and solving them from a manually entered board or an uploaded
image. This project will showcase your skills with user interfaces, data validation, algorithms,
and possibly even image processing—all essential tools for a strong developer.
You’ll complete this challenge through a series of progressive targets, with each milestone
building on the previous one. Complete as many as you can within the maximum allocated
time of two weeks. You’re welcome to submit your work earlier if you’re ready!
Challenge Targets and Timeline


# Target 1: Basic Game UI and Manual Input
**• Objective: Set up a React application and design the Sudoku grid interface.**
• Features:
• Create a 9x9 Sudoku board with editable cells.
• Allow users to enter numbers from 1 to 9 in each cell.
• Bonus: Add simple styling for a polished look.

# Target 2: Game Logic and Validation
**• Objective: Implement validation for Sudoku rules.**
## • Features:
• Ensure that rows, columns, and 3x3 grids have unique numbers.
• Highlight conflicts if the entered numbers violate Sudoku rules.
• Bonus: Add a “check solution” button to validate a completed board.

# Target 3: Sudoku Puzzle Generator
**• Objective: Create a generator for random, solvable Sudoku puzzles.**
## • Features:
• Generate puzzles at different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).
• Use an algorithm (such as backtracking) to ensure each puzzle has a unique solution.
• Bonus: Add a difficulty selection feature for generating puzzles.

# Target 4: Manual Solver
**• Objective: Implement a solver that can solve a manually entered board.**
## • Features:
• Allow users to input an incomplete Sudoku board and solve it with a “solve” button.
• Display the solution on the board.
• Bonus: Implement a “hint” button to reveal a single correct number at a time.

# Stretch Goal: Image-Based Solver
**• Objective: Allow the app to solve Sudoku from an uploaded image.**
## • Features:
• Integrate OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to detect numbers from an uploaded image.
• Interpret and display the recognized board on the UI, then solve it.
• Bonus: Implement feedback for handling unclear or incomplete images.
